# PhysicsQA-GPT: Transformer-Based Q&A Model for "Motion in a Plane" (Class 11 Physics)

PhysicsQA-GPT is a domain-specific Question-Answering (QA) bot focused exclusively on the "Motion in a Plane" chapter from Class 11 Physics. Built using a custom Decoder-Only Transformer architecture, the system provides accurate, context-aware answers to user questions, leveraging a tailored vocabulary and tokenizer. The project is implemented in PyTorch and deployed via FastAPI, with an interactive web frontend.

## üìò Project Overview

PhysicsQA-GPT is designed to help students master the concepts of "Motion in a Plane," including vectors, projectile motion, and two-dimensional kinematics. It leverages a deep learning model trained on curated QA pairs, offering fast and relevant responses to natural language queries.

### Key Learning Areas Covered

- Vectors and their resolution in a plane  
- Scalar and vector quantities  
- Equations of motion in two dimensions  
- Projectile motion and uniform circular motion  
- Application of Newton‚Äôs laws in a plane

## üß† Key Features

- **Custom Decoder-Only Transformer**: 6-layer, 8-head attention model trained on chapter-specific QA data.  
- **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Focused solely on "Motion in a Plane" (Class 11 Physics).  
- **Custom Tokenizer & Vocabulary**: Utilizes special tokens (`<PAD>`, `<BOS>`, `<EOS>`, `<SEP>`) for efficient sequence processing.  
- **REST API with FastAPI**: Exposes endpoints for answer generation and serves a static HTML frontend.  
- **Interactive Frontend**: Simple web interface for user interaction.
